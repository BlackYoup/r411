r411
====

A simple web interface for the [T411](https://t411.ai) website built in rust.

## Run

Install a nightly version of rust through [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) for rocket to work: https://rocket.rs/guide/getting-started/#installing-rust

Then, `cargo run` will launch it on the port `8000`.

## Motivation

Inspired by [T412](https://github.com/matthiasbosc/t412) made by [matthiasbosc](https://github.com/matthiasbosc).

I'm not very confortable with PHP and couldn't find my way into the project.
Plus, I'm in my rust period and I never did a website with a popular framework
so it was the right time to try.


## Disclaimer

I'm not sure this will ever be good enough to be used, but I'll try to add
some of the features T412 already has plus the ones I wanted to add.
